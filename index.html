One of my favorite hobbies is playing sports and basically excericising in general. I started playing soccer over a decade ago when I was a toddler. My Dad forced me to join, but eventually I developed a love for the sport. I prefer to play the game rather than watch it. I have played on several teams over the years and now I play once a week, on Sundays with a team of friends. We have gone on to the finals of many championships and are first place in our league. I love excercising because I love to spend my energy into doing something active. When excercising, I can't help but think of improving my body every time I am out on the field or court just playing with friends and sometimes family.

        Another one of my hobbies is binge watching Television shows. Whether it is superhero shows or dramas, if it catches my attention, I will watch every single episode of the show as I possibly can because I can't deal with not knowing what happens to the character in the next show, or how the season and show end. After finishing the show, I can't help but feel a little lost as I try out some other TV shows, trying to find another to satisfy my need to binge. Although an unhealthy hobby, I love binge watching shows because after finishing the show, it gives me a feeling of success.
